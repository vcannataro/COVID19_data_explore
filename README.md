Repository to explore COVID19 data. 

I am using these data to learn how to clean + plot time series and spatial data. No medical or scientific conclusions should be made using the analyses within this repository. 

Figures are updated within the [figures subfolder](https://github.com/vcannataro/COVID19_data_explore/tree/master/output_data/figures)

Spatial data exploration movies are mainly within [tests](https://github.com/vcannataro/COVID19_data_explore/tree/master/output_data/figures/tests)

Scripts to reproduce these figures are found within the main code directory (e.g. [exploring_counties.R](https://github.com/vcannataro/COVID19_data_explore/blob/master/exploring_counties.R) produces [all_states_VS_each_state.pdf](https://github.com/vcannataro/COVID19_data_explore/blob/master/output_data/figures/all_states_VS_each_state.pdf)) or within the [analyses](https://github.com/vcannataro/COVID19_data_explore/tree/master/analyses) subdirectory.
