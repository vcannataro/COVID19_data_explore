Why do reported new daily cases fluctuate by the day of the week? This has been [attributed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363007/) to fluctuations in the daily variation in testing. Typically, reported cases are higher Thursday, Friday, and Saturday because testing is available early in the week. Testing may not be available on the weekend in many locations, leading to lower reporting early in the week. 

```{r, echo=F,warning=F, message=F}
nytimes_data_lagged_state <- nytimes_county %>%
  group_by(state,date) %>%
  summarize(total_state = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(state,date) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(lag_cases = total_state - dplyr::lag(total_state,default = 0)) %>%
  filter(lag_cases >= 0) 


nytimes_data_lagged_state$`Day of the week` <- lubridate::wday(nytimes_data_lagged_state$date,
                                                  label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)



ggplot(data = nytimes_data_lagged_state) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=date,y=lag_cases,fill=`Day of the week`),stat= "identity") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  # coord_cartesian(xlim=as.Date(c("2020-03-15",max(nytimes_data_lagged_state$date)))) +
  labs(y="Total new cases per day", 
       x= "Date",

       caption = paste("Data: The New York Times, https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

```





## Nation-wide vs. state-by-state

Here, I explore how individual states contribute to the total USA case count. I focus on MA, NY, and NJ because 1) this is where cases were high early in the epidemic and 2) many of my friends and family live in these states.  

```{r, warning=F,message=F, echo=F}

```

```{r, warning=F,message=F, echo=F}

# New England

```{r, echo=F,warning=F,message=F}
NE_states_plot
```




# Massachusetts


```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# TODO: to account for anomalies we need to have a separate variable for 
# true reported cases (even negative) to cumsum() over. 
nytimes_data_lagged <- nytimes_county %>%
  group_by(state,county) %>%
  mutate(lag_cases = cases - dplyr::lag(cases,default = 0)) %>%
  filter(lag_cases >= 0) %>%
  # filter(county != "Unknown") %>%
  mutate(county = dplyr::recode(county, Unknown = "County not specified")) %>%
  mutate(lag_cases_rollmean = zoo::rollmean(x = lag_cases,7,na.pad=T))

just_MA <- nytimes_data_lagged %>% 
  filter(state=="Massachusetts") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(total_lag_cases = sum(lag_cases)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%

```


In the NYTimes [anomaly notes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/massachusetts-coronavirus-cases.html#anomaly-notes) they describe the various anomalies that occurred in MA data collection and reportingâ€”including things like releases of backlogs of data (causing large spikes) and dates of system maintenance (causing missing data for a day). They also describe incidents of MA state revising its methodology for case counts, leading to a "decrease" in new daily case numbers as they adjust their overall numbers on that specific day. For more information, see the [anomaly notes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/massachusetts-coronavirus-cases.html#anomaly-notes).
